👋 Hi, i'm The Real Plastic Man!

- 🤯 I’m currently working on a personal.private (project); & Private Truckers App in Chile!
- 📚 Also i'm learning language libraries and cybersecurity enginnering.
- 🗯️ My languages are Phyton, JS and Swift.
- 👍🏻 I’m looking to collaborate with translations and mindfulness psychology to people who needs.
- 🤓 "Fun" fact: I'm a self-tought programmer (FSD). I started to learn when i got my first home-use PC in 2005. My first "official" approach to programming was creating a web page for my class in HTML (2008). Later i start to create Habbo Retro's servers and Tumblr themes. The rest is history.
